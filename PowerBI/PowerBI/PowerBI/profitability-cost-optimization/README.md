# Profitability & Cost Optimization Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes business profitability with a focus on cost drivers, discount impact, and loss-making products. The goal is to identify where profit is generated, where it is lost, and how pricing and discount strategies affect overall margins.

## Business Questions
- Which product categories contribute the most to total profit?
- How do different discount levels impact profitability?
- Which regions drive the highest profit?
- Which products are consistently loss-making?

## Key Insights
- Technology and Office Supplies account for the majority of total profit.
- Furniture contributes significantly less profit and appears frequently among loss-making products.
- Discounts above 40% consistently reduce profitability, with steep declines at higher discount levels.
- Profit losses are highly concentrated among a small set of products, suggesting targeted corrective action would be effective.
- The West and East regions drive the largest share of total profit.
