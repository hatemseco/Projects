# AIDER — Emergency Response Image Analysis 

---

## Overview
This project analyzes aerial images from the **AIDER (Aerial Image Dataset for Emergency Response)** to support emergency management and disaster response scenarios. The objective is to explore and model visual patterns in aerial imagery that are relevant to emergency situations such as floods, fires, damaged infrastructure, and rescue operations.

The project demonstrates the application of computer vision techniques to real-world, high-impact emergency response data.
