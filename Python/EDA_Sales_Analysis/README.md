# Sales Exploratory Data Analysis 

---

## Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on sales data to understand revenue behavior, distributions, trends, and relationships between key variables. The objective is to uncover patterns, anomalies, and insights that support data-driven decision-making in a sales context.

The project emphasizes structured EDA, visualization, and analytical interpretation.
