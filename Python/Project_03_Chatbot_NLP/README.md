# Chatbot Project (NLP)

## Overview
This project implements a conversational chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to process raw text data, transform it into structured features, and train a model capable of generating appropriate responses to user input.

The project demonstrates a complete NLP pipeline, from text preprocessing to model-driven conversational interaction.

---

## Objectives
- Build a chatbot using NLP-based text processing
- Transform unstructured text into model-ready features
- Train a model to generate responses based on learned patterns
- Create a simple interaction loop for user–chatbot communication

---

## Methods & Workflow
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization and vocabulary creation
- Feature engineering for text representation
- Model training for chatbot response generation
- Chat interaction loop (user input → model prediction → response)
- Evaluation of chatbot behavior and response quality

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning

---

## Key Insights
- Text preprocessing plays a critical role in chatbot response quality
- Tokenization and feature representation strongly influence model behavior
- Even simple models can produce meaningful interactions within a defined domain
- Model performance improves with cleaner and more consistent training data
