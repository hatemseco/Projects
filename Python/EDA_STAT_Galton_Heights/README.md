# Galton Family Heights — EDA & Prediction Model 

---

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Galton Family Heights dataset** using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling. The objective is to study the relationship between parents’ heights and child height, and to build predictive models that estimate child height based on family attributes.

The project demonstrates data exploration, feature engineering, visualization, and supervised regression modeling using Python.

## Dataset
- Galton Family Heights dataset
- Measurements of:
  - Father height
  - Mother height
  - Child height
  - Gender
- Structured tabular dataset suitable for statistical analysis and regression

---

## Objectives
- Explore height distributions and relationships within families
- Analyze correlations between parent and child heights
- Engineer meaningful features for prediction
- Build regression models to predict child height
- Evaluate model performance using regression metrics

---

## Data Preparation
- Loaded the dataset using Python
- Inspected data structure and data types
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
- Created engineered features (e.g., midparent height)
- Prepared features and target variables for modeling
- Split data into training and testing sets

---
