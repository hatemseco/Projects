# Health Expenditure Analysis

---

## Overview
This project analyzes healthcare expenditure data to understand spending patterns, trends, and relationships across time and regions. The objective is to explore how health spending evolves and to identify key factors associated with changes in expenditure.

The project demonstrates data-driven analysis using exploratory data analysis, trend evaluation, and statistical interpretation to support insights in the healthcare domain.
