# Trade & Tariffs Analysis (Python)

## Overview
This project analyzes global trade and tariff data to understand how tariff changes impact trade performance and economic indicators. Using Python-based exploratory analysis and statistical modeling, the project transforms raw trade data into actionable insights that support data-driven economic and policy evaluation.

Linear regression is applied to quantify relationships between tariff levels and trade-related metrics, helping identify patterns and sensitivities across time.
