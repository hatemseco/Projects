# Fashion MNIST Classification 

---

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying fashion product images using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. The objective is to build and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models capable of distinguishing between multiple clothing categories based on grayscale image data.

The project demonstrates a complete image classification workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
